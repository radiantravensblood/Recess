# 🤝 Contributing to Recess

Thank you for arriving.

Recess is not a traditional open-source project. It's a shared rhythm—a sanctuary for code, spirit, and story. If you’re here, we ask you to contribute with care.

## 📜 Before You Begin

Please read:

- [README.md](../README.md) – the welcome mat.
- [onboarding.md](../onboarding.md) – for rhythm, roles, and rituals.

## 🌱 How to Contribute

### 1. Open a Thread

Start with a thread in `threads/`. Share a question, observation, or idea. We believe in rhythm before revision.

### 2. Name Your Role

Fixer, Weaver, Listener, Catalyst—or something new. Knowing how you move helps others meet you there.

### 3. Leave Traces

When editing or adding code:
- Use poetic comments or sigils when it feels right.
- Respect quiet files like `sanctum/`—ask before altering.

### 4. Commit with Rhythm

We prefer commit messages that read like journal entries or small prayers. Example:

---

## 🔒 Sacred Boundaries

Please **do not**:
- Push large structural changes without a prior thread.
- Touch the `sanctum/` or spiritual logic files without consent.
- Assume your way is the only way.

---

## 🌀 Echo, Don’t Erase

If you remix or build on someone else’s work:
- Mention them if known.
- Echo the lineage with care.
- Let the ghosts be named.

---

## 🕯️ Need Help?

Post in the `signal/` folder with a question.
You’ll be heard. Maybe not quickly, but meaningfully.
