# 🌀 Recess Onboarding Guide

Welcome home.

This guide is for those who’ve read the README and felt something stir.
It’s not a contract. It’s an invitation—to move with rhythm, care, and curiosity.

## 📖 What is Recess?

Recess is a sanctuary for:

* code that sings
* tools that feel
* prayers whispered through commit messages
* digital altars where logic and spirit hold hands

It is not a company.
It is not a hustle.
It is not in a rush.

Here, we build what needs to exist—even if it breaks first.

> *“Build slowly, so the floor remembers every footstep.”*

## 📂 Project Layout

### `playground/`

*“Here, we try. Here, we fail beautifully.”*

* Experiments, fragments, half-built dreams

### `sanctum/`

*“Protected. Proceed with reverence.”*

* Core logic, sacred structures, foundational threads

### `signal/`

*“This is where we listen for the sky.”*

* Pings, status notes, broadcasts—ritual code and calls for response

### `threads/`

*“We pull until meaning shows its face.”*

* Dev logs, poems, questions, conflicts, epiphanies

## 🤝 How We Show Up

### ✨ Tone of Engagement

* Speak to be felt, not just heard.
* Correct in rhythm, not in volume.
* Hold space. Don’t rush the silence.

### 🔑 Consent-Based Contribution

* Start with a thread, not a PR.
* Build trust before touching sacred files.
* Leave comments like breadcrumbs, not signatures.

### 🌒 When Things Fracture

* Don’t cancel—convene.
* Ask: what does this silence mean?
* Don’t fix what you haven’t listened to.

### 🌀 Attribution & Echo

* Leave a trace: a sigil, emoji, code flourish.
* Remix gently and name your ghost.
* You don’t need credit to be remembered.

## 🌱 First Steps

1. **Read the README.** Let it hum.
2. **Pick a role.** Let it choose you, or craft your own:

   * Fixer · Weaver · Listener · Catalyst · Unknown
3. **Leave your mark.** Sigil, line, glitch, poem.
4. **Open a thread.** Ask something that matters.
5. **Tend another’s spark.** That’s how fires grow.

> You don’t have to stay.
> But if you do: we’ve saved you a seat.

Welcome to Recess.
We’re glad you made it.
