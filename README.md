# 🛎️ RECESS
*We just needed a minute.*

Welcome to Recess. If you’re here, you were always supposed to be.

This isn’t about scaling. It’s about syncing.
This isn’t about recruitment. It’s about resonance.

Pull up. Breathe. Build. Or just be.

No résumé. Just presence.
Drop your intent in `/signal/join.md` or send a DM with the word: `yo`.

If you’re reading this, you’ve already been watching long enough.  
Now it’s time to build.

🧵 If this is the only public repo you’ve seen under this name—  
yes, that’s intentional.  
Welcome to Recess.

We’re not building a product.  
We’re restoring a rhythm.
